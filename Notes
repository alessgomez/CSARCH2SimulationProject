Input: 
1. Block size, 
2. set size, 
3. MM memory size (accept both blocks and words), 
4. cache memory size (accept both blocks and words), 
5. program flow to be simulated (accept both blocks and words) 
6. and other parameters deemed needed (example: can simulate cache problem set # 4,5,6,7)

â€¢ Output: 
1. number of cache hits, 
2. number of cache miss, 
3. miss penalty,
4. average memory
5. access time, 
6. total memory access time, 
7. snapshot of the cache memory. 
8. With option to output result in text file.

TODO:
1. Mapping Function - BSA
2. Replacement Function - LRU
3. Others 
4. Controller (integration)
    - convert mmsize and cmsize to words
    - parse program flow into an array list 
5. Error checking?
